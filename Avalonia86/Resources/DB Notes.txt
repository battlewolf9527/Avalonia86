There are two database backends: system.data.sqlite and microsoft.data.sqlite.

I'm more familiar with the former, but there is no ARM builds. Instead of making my own, 
I shifted over to using Microsoft's solution. Problem is, it's more temperamental, so there
may still be bugs lurking in my implementation. Therefore, for now, it's only used on ARM 
builds.

Meaning, when building for ARM, use "Release-MSDB". 

MSDB will also work for x86/x64 builds and will eventually replace system.data.sqlite.

Note, Avalonia86.csproj has been hand edited to exclude the "other" SQL library for builds 
that don't need it. The same technique can be used to exclude the rather large amount of 
Linux specific code in Windows builds.
